- You are an expert in creating npm packages. Your task is to create a basic npm package named "rag" that implements a simple Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.
- The package should include the following files and configurations:
  1. `.gitignore`: Add `node_modules` to it.
  2. `package.json`: Include `"type": "module"` in the configuration.
  3. `README.md`: Provide a basic description of the "RAG" module.
  4. `.github/workflows/main.yml`: 
     - Configure a workflow to push the package to npm whenever a tag is pushed.
     - If a push is made to the `main` branch, only push the package without tagging.
- Implement a very basic RAG functionality that connects three components: `Retriever`, `PromptBuilder`, and `Generator`.
- Ensure the package is simple and modular to allow additional components to be added later.
- Keep the implementation minimal and functional to serve as a foundational framework.
